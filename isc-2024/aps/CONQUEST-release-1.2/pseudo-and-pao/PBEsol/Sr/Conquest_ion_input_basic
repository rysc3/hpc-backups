# Polarisation orbitals are potentially problematic for Groups I and II.
# The highest energy valence orbital is l=0 so the polarisation orbital
# using the standard perturbative approach would be l=1, but that would 
# mean a basis set with only l=0 and l=1.  It is also possible to polarise 
# perturbatively from the highest energy l=1 orbital to give a polarisation 
# orbital with l=2 using the lines below, but this will be perturbing a
# semi-core state and will give a basis where the only l=1 orbitals are
# semi-core states.  This may not be reliable: we recommend careful testing
# should you choose this route.
