Note that we have changed the electronic configuration of the Pd
atom from 4d10 (as given in the original PseudoDojo inputs) to
4d9 5s1 (in line with many DFT codes).  This makes no significant
different to the fcc lattice constant, and improves the default
basis set immensely.

If you require the original 4d10 configuration, then please contact
the developers.
