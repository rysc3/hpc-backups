This directory contains sample pseudopotentials and pseudo-atomic
orbital (PAO) basis sets for elements in the [PseudoDojo
database](http://www.pseudo-dojo.org) (roughly speaking up to 86Rn).

It also includes the input files you will need for generating basis
sets of your own using the CONQUEST basis generation code.  More
details are found in the documentation directory.

The potentials are available for LDA, PBE and PBEsol
exchange-correlation functionals.
