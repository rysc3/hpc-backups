# The basis set created by this file should be fairly reliable,
# and we recommend using it, or adapting it to make larger basis
# sets by changing the number of zeta functions and their radii
# in the BasisBlock below.  At present it is a DZP size basis
# (though there are two types of polarisation orbital, l=1 and l=2)

General.NumberOfSpecies 1
# The 5p shell should really be semi-core, so change the cutoff energy
