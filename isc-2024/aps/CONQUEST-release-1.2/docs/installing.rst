Installation
============

You will need to download and compile the code before you can use it;
we do not supply binaries.

Downloading
-----------

CONQUEST is accessed from `the GitHub repository
<https://github.com/OrderN/CONQUEST-release/>`_;
it can be cloned:

``git clone https://github.com/OrderN/CONQUEST-release destination-directory``

where ``destination-directory`` should be set by the user.
Alternatively, it can be downloaded from GitHub as a zip file and
unpacked: 

`<https://github.com/OrderN/CONQUEST-release/archive/master.zip>`_

Compiling
---------

Once you have the distribution, you will need to compile the main
Conquest code (found in the ``src/`` directory), along with the ion file
generation code (found in the ``tools/`` directory).  Conquest requires
a working MPI installation including a Fortran90 compiler (often
``mpif90`` but this can vary), along with a few standard libraries:

* BLAS and LAPACK (normally provided by the system vendor)
* FFTW 3.x (more detail can be found at `http://www.fftw.org/ <http://www.fftw.org/>`_)
* ScaLAPACK (often provided as part of an HPC system; the source code
  can be obtained from `the netlib repository <http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/>`_ if
  you need to compile it)

Additionally, Conquest can use LibXC if it is available (v2.x or
later).

The library locations are set in the ``system.make`` file in the ``src/``
directory, along with other parameters needed for compilation.

* ``FC`` (typically ``FC=mpif90`` will be all that is required)
* ``COMPFLAGS`` (set these to specify compiler options such as
  optimisation)
* ``BLAS`` (specify the BLAS and LAPACK libraries)
* ``SCALAPACK`` (specify the ScaLAPACK library)
* ``FFT_LIB`` (must be left as FFTW)
* ``XC_LIBRARY`` (choose ``XC_LIBRARY=CQ`` for the internal Conquest
  library, otherwise ``XC_LIBRARY=LibXC_v2or3`` for LibXC v2.x or v3.x, or ``XC_LIBRARY=LibXC_v4``
  for LibXC v4.x)
* Two further options need to be set for LibXC:

  + ``XC_LIB`` (specify the XC libraries)
  + ``XC_COMPFLAGS`` (specify the location of the LibXC include and
    module files, e.g. ``-I/usr/local/include``)

Once these are set, you should make the executable using ``make``.

The ion file generation code is compiled using the same options
required for the main code.
